# Spectre: Hackathon Pitch Outline & Business Model

## 1. The Hook (The Problem)
*"By 2026, 80% of on-chain trading volume will be driven by autonomous AI agents. But right now, those agents are bleeding capital."*

**The Problem: The AI Front-Running Crisis**
When an AI agent executes a trade on Solana today, its entire decision-making process—its parameters, its strategy, its target entry/exit points—is public or easily deducible. MEV bots and adversarial actors constantly analyze agent behavior, resulting in **logic-analysis exploitation** and **front-running**. 
If you build the smartest open-source AI trader in the world, the moment it hits the mempool, someone will steal its alpha.

## 2. The Solution: Spectre
**Spectre is the Confidential Operating System for Agentic Commerce.**

We combine two distinct hardware-encrypted Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to create a black box where agents can think, decide, and act without ever exposing their logic.
1.  **The Compute TEE (Phala Network):** Houses the ElizaOS brain. It thinks and plans in absolute privacy.
2.  **The State TEE (MagicBlock PER):** Houses the capital. It executes the trades on Solana via Ephemeral Rollups gaslessly and hidden from the mempool, only committing the final result to L1.

*Result:* The public sees "Wallet X bought 500 SOL." They do not see *why* Wallet X bought it, and they cannot front-run the trade before it executes.

## 3. The Unfair Advantage (Why Now?)
- **MagicBlock's Private Ephemeral Rollups (PER)** just brought Intel TDX state-shielding to Solana.
- **ElizaOS** and **Solana Agent Kit v2** have matured enough to make complex AI agents accessible.
- We are the *first* middleware to fuse ElizaOS with MagicBlock PERs, providing a 1-click "Deploy & Shield" experience for developers.

## 4. Business Model & Monetization
How does Spectre make money and scale into a massive enterprise?

1.  **B2B SaaS API (Infrastructure as a Service):** 
    - Charging crypto funds, hedge funds, and premium agent developers a monthly subscription to host their agents across our Phala/MagicBlock TEE node clusters.
    - Free tier for Devnet; paid execution tiers based on transaction volume (e.g., $499/mo for up to 10k shielded tx/mo).
2.  **Performance Fee (The "Spectre Vault"):** 
    - Retail users can deposit funds into "Spectre Certified" community trading agents.
    - Spectre takes a 1% routing/shielding fee on the net profit generated by these agents in exchange for providing the front-running protection infrastructure.
3.  **Future Token Utility ($SPECTRE):**
    - Used to stake on TEE validator nodes for increased security and decentralization of the Compute TEE network.

## 5. The Demo (What the Judges Will See)
We will showcase a live split-screen UI:
- **Left:** An unshielded AI agent attempting to trade on an AMM. We launch a basic MEV script that successfully reads its intent and front-runs it, costing the agent 3% slippage.
- **Right:** The *exact same* agent, deployed via the Spectre Dashboard. We show the Phala Attestation Certificate proving the Intel TDX enclave is active. The agent trades, the MEV script sees nothing until the final L1 commit, and the agent secures the absolute best price from Jupiter.

## 6. Target Audience
- **DeFi Agent Builders:** Anyone using ElizaOS, SAK, or custom Python bots who wants to protect their trading alpha.
- **Quant Funds:** Traditional funds looking to move on-chain without exposing their proprietary algorithms.
- **Retail Users:** Through the dashboard, non-technical users can launch pre-configured strategy agents knowing they are protected by institutional-grade TEE security.
